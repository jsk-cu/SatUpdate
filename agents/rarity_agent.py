"""
Rarity Agent Module - Global Knowledge Variant

Implements an enhanced rarest-first strategy where each satellite maintains
knowledge of what packets every other satellite has. This information is
shared during broadcasts and used to make better-informed rarity decisions.

Key features:
1. Each satellite tracks every packet that every other satellite has
2. During broadcast, satellites share their global knowledge
3. When making requests, knowledge is updated via union with neighbor broadcasts
4. Request decisions are based on global rarity (fewest holders constellation-wide)
5. Requests are deduplicated to avoid requesting the same packet from multiple neighbors

This approach provides more accurate rarity estimates compared to local-only
knowledge, approaching the benefits of network coding without the complexity.

Source: Inspired by BitTorrent's rarest-first and informed gossip protocols.

class RarityAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Agent with global packet knowledge that prioritizes requesting rarest packets.

    Each agent maintains a local view of what packets every satellite has.
    This knowledge is:
    - Shared in broadcasts so neighbors can update their views
    - Updated when making requests (union with neighbor knowledge)
    - Updated when responding to requests (requestor gains packet)
    - Updated when receiving packets (self gains packet)

    The request strategy prioritizes packets that the fewest satellites have
    according to the agent's global knowledge, avoiding duplicate requests
    to different neighbors within the same round.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_id : int
        Unique identifier. 0 = base station, 1+ = satellites.
    num_packets : int
        Total packets in the software update.
    num_satellites : int
        Total satellites in the constellation.
    is_base_station : bool
        True if this is the base station agent.

    Attributes
    ----------
    knowledge : Dict[int, Set[int]]
        Maps agent_id -> set of packets we believe that agent has.
        Includes ourselves and all other known agents.
