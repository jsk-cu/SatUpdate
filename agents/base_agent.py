"""
Base Agent Class for Satellite Constellation Packet Distribution

Provides a template class for agents that manage packet distribution
in a satellite constellation. Each satellite and the base station
receives an agent that decides how to broadcast state, make requests,
and fulfill requests from neighbors.

The protocol runs in 4 phases each timestep:
1. broadcast_state() - All agents broadcast their state
2. make_requests() - All agents request packets from neighbors
3. receive_requests_and_update() - All agents decide what to send
4. receive_packets_and_update() - All agents receive packets

    Base template class for satellite constellation agents.
    
    This template class provides the interface for agents that manage
    packet distribution in a satellite constellation. Subclasses should
    implement the actual logic for deciding what to broadcast, request,
    and send.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    agent_id : int
        Unique integer identifier for this agent
    num_packets : int
        Total number of packets that make up the software update
    num_satellites : int
        Total number of satellites in the constellation
    is_base_station : bool
        True if this agent represents the base station (which starts
        with all packets), False for satellite agents
    
    Attributes
    ----------
